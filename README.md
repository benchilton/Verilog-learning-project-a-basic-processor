A project I undertook to help me understand hardware description languages better.

The implementation of this processor is somewhat incomplete and unlikely to be expanded on in the future. The purpose of the program was to help my learning.

Current implementation is using a multicyle MIPs style processor.
Not all instructions are implemented yet and the MIPs currently doesnt have dedicated data memory.
